# Password Manager: Version Comparison

## Phase 1 (Initial Release)
**Core**
- Basic OOP implementation
- Mixed-case naming convention

**Features**
- User registration/login
- Password storage & generation

**Limitations**
- Inconsistent code style
- Basic validation/error handling
- Limited extension capabilities

---

## Phase 2 (Enhanced Release)
**Structural Improvements**
- Standardized lowercase naming
- Refactored abstract classes
- Better code organization

**Security Upgrades**
- Enhanced key rotation
- Activity logging system
- Password strength evaluation

**New Functionality**
- Configurable password generator
- Advanced form validation
- Password metadata support
  - Categories
  - Favorites

**Performance**
- Optimized database queries
- Streamlined crypto operations
- Improved documentation

---

## Phase 3 (Core Refinements & Stability)
**Core**
- **`require_once` Corrections:** Systematic debugging and correction of file inclusion paths (`require_once` statements) to ensure consistent and correct loading of all classes and configurations.
- **Enhanced Class Loading:** Established a robust foundation for inter-class communication and functionality.

**Features**
- Improved application stability and reliability.
- Seamless communication between core OOP components.

**Limitations**
- Initial debugging challenges related to file inclusion paths.

---

## Phase 4 (Finalization & Deployment Readiness)
**Structural Improvements**
- **Systematic Error Resolution:** Comprehensive identification and removal of remaining logical and syntax errors across the application.
- **Database Integration:** Ensured robust and error-free interaction with the MySQL database, including successful table creation and initial data population.

**New Functionality**
- **Installation State Management:** Introduction of `installed.php` (or similar) to manage the application's installation state, preventing accidental re-initialization and indicating readiness for use.

**Security Upgrades**
- **Database Population Validation:** Verification of data integrity during initial population (e.g., proper hashing, encryption).

### **Development Workflow & Debugging Strategy**

Throughout Phases 3 and 4, a specific dual-directory workflow was employed to facilitate debugging and ensure code stability:

* **Primary Development (`C:\Users\melod\phpfinal`):** This directory served as the main development environment and the local Git repository for all code changes and version control.
* **XAMPP Web Root (`C:\Users\xampp\htdocs\phpfinal`):** This was the live web server environment. Changes from the primary development directory were manually copied here for real-time testing and debugging via the browser.

This approach explains why the commit history reflects files being organized into their respective folders/directories. Individual files or small sets of changes were copied and debugged in the `htdocs` environment until errors were resolved. Only then were these verified changes committed back to the primary Git repository, ensuring that the version history represents stable, debugged iterations of the codebase. This iterative process was crucial for resolving complex errors and ensuring the application's functionality before final integration.
