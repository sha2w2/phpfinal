# Phase 1 & 1.1: Initial Implementation

Core Architecture: Implemented a basic object-oriented (OOP) structure using a mixed-case naming convention.
Security Features:
Employed AES-256 encryption for password storage.
Utilized Bcrypt for password hashing.
Implemented session-based authentication.
Functionality:
Enabled user registration and login.
Provided basic password storage and retrieval.
Offered simple password generation.
Limitations:
Suffered from inconsistent code style.
Featured minimal input validation.
Had basic error handling.
Offered limited extensibility.
Phase 2: Enhanced Implementation

Structural Improvements:
Adopted a standardized lowercase naming convention for classes, methods, and variables.
Refactored abstract classes and interfaces for better design.
Improved code organization through better separation of concerns.
Security Enhancements:
Strengthened key rotation mechanisms.
Added activity logging for auditing.
Implemented password strength evaluation.
Enhanced session management for improved security.
Functional Upgrades:
Enabled advanced password generation with configurable parameters.
Implemented comprehensive form validation.
Improved error handling and user feedback.
Extended password metadata support (categories, favorites).
Technical Improvements:
Optimized the database schema.
Streamlined cryptographic operations for efficiency.
Reduced code complexity.
Improved documentation.
Key Changes: Phase 1.1 to Phase 2

Consistency: Standardized naming conventions for improved maintainability.
Security: Enhanced encryption and auditing capabilities.
